# skill-issue

skill-issue is an AI-powered platform that helps college students stop getting ghosted by employers. Students upload their resume and paste job posting links, then our system analyzes exactly where they stack up against requirements, predicting their likelihood of landing the role and identifying specific skill gaps. Instead of blindly applying to hundreds of jobs and wondering why they're getting rejected, students get actionable insights on which skills to develop and a clear roadmap to become competitive for their dream positions. It transforms the anxiety-inducing job hunt into a strategic, data-driven process.
